# Traffic_light_controller
This repository contains the Verilog code for a traffic light controller. The controller can be used to control traffic at a T-intersection. The input to the controller is the current state of the traffic lights, and the output is the next state of the traffic lights.
The controller transitions from one state to the next based on the current state of the traffic lights and the input from the user.The controller is designed to ensure that traffic flows smoothly and safely at the intersection.
The controller is tested using a simulator. The simulator allows you to input different traffic scenarios and see how the controller reacts.

This project is a good starting point for learning how to implement a traffic light controller in Verilog. It can also be used as a reference for other projects that involve controlling traffic lights.

Here are some additional details to the repository description:
vs code has been used as text editor 
icraus verilog has been used as simulator
gtk wave is used to generate the required waveforms
